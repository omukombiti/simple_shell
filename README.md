Imagine you have a little helper who understands your language and can do tasks for you. You tell your helper what you want to do, and they take care of the details.

So, when you use a shell in C, it's like talking to this helper in a special computer language. You give the helper commands, just like telling them what to do, and they communicate with the computer on your behalf. They can run programs, manage files, and make sure things work smoothly, all while you stay in control.

Just like your helper understands your instructions and translates them into actions, the shell in C understands the commands you type and turns them into actions the computer can perform.
